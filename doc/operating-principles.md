# Operating Principles (How I run production)

- **SLO-first:** alert on user impact, not infrastructure noise  
- **Safe change:** progressive delivery + rollback paths before shipping  
- **Automate toil:** repeatable pipelines and IaC over manual operations  
- **Blameless postmortems:** improve systems, not blame people  
- **Security-by-default:** least privilege, auditability, and supply chain controls baked into delivery
