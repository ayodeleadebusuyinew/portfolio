# Ayodele Adebusuyi — Cloud / DevOps / SRE
## AWS Cloud Focus (Production)

I build and operate production platforms primarily on **AWS**, with deep hands-on delivery across:

- **Networking:** VPC, subnets, route tables, IGW/NAT, VPC endpoints, security groups, NACLs
- **Compute & Containers:** EC2, **EKS**, Auto Scaling, Launch Templates, ECR
- **Identity & Security:** IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager/Parameter Store, CloudTrail, AWS Config (guardrails), IRSA for EKS
- **Traffic & Edge:** ALB/NLB, Ingress Controllers, Route 53, ACM, WAF (when applicable)
- **Data & Messaging (as needed):** RDS, DynamoDB, S3, SQS/SNS
- **Observability:** CloudWatch, logs/metrics alarms, plus Datadog/Prometheus/Grafana patterns


I design and operate secure, automated cloud platforms that scale in production — with strong focus on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD reliability, observability, and security/compliance.

## What I build
- Secure, repeatable cloud foundations (AWS-first)
- Kubernetes platforms and release safety (canary + rollback)
- IaC automation that reduces manual operations
- Observability aligned to SLOs and operational readiness
- DevSecOps guardrails that keep teams fast and compliant
