# Ayodele Adebusuyi — Cloud / DevOps / SRE

I design and operate secure, automated cloud platforms that scale in production — with strong focus on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD reliability, observability, and security/compliance.

## What I build
- Secure, repeatable cloud foundations (AWS-first)
- Kubernetes platforms and release safety (canary + rollback)
- IaC automation that reduces manual operations
- Observability aligned to SLOs and operational readiness
- DevSecOps guardrails that keep teams fast and compliant
