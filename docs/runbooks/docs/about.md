# About

I’m **Ayodele Adebusuyi** — Cloud / DevOps / SRE focused on building secure, automated platforms that run reliably in production.

## Operating style
- **Automation-first**: if it repeats, it gets codified (Terraform, pipelines, scripts, runbooks)
- **Safety-first releases**: canary/blue-green, health checks, fast rollback
- **Reliability discipline**: SLOs, alert quality, incident readiness, postmortems that drive change
- **Security-by-default**: guardrails built into delivery and runtime patterns
