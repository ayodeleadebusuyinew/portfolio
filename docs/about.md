# About

I’m **Ayodele Adebusuyi** — Cloud / DevOps / SRE focused on building secure, automated platforms that run reliably in production.

## What I build
- Secure, repeatable cloud foundations (IaC-first)
- Kubernetes platforms with safe releases (canary + rollback)
- Observability aligned to SLOs and on-call actionability
- DevSecOps guardrails that keep teams fast and compliant
