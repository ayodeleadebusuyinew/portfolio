# Modernization & Automation for Cloud Delivery

## Executive summary
Improved delivery speed and reliability by pushing repetitive work into automation, IaC, and standardized deployment practices.

## Context
Modernization goals typically include:
- Faster, repeatable environment provisioning
- Reduced manual operational load
- Better reliability via observability and incident readiness

## What I contributed
- **IaC standardization**: repeatable infrastructure patterns for consistency
- **Automation**: scripts and pipelines to remove manual steps
- **Operational readiness**: monitoring baselines + runbook-driven response
- **Release safety**: structured rollout and rollback expectations

## Outcomes (update with your real numbers later)
- Reduced manual ops overhead
- Faster provisioning and safer deployments
- Stronger production posture through standard patterns
