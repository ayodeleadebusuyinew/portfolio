# About

I’m Ayodele Adebusuyi — a Cloud/DevOps/SRE engineer focused on building secure, automated platforms that run reliably in production.

## What you can expect from my work
- Clean, repeatable infrastructure patterns (IaC-first)
- Delivery pipelines with release safety (canary/rollback)
- Strong operational discipline (SLOs, runbooks, incident readiness)
- Security embedded into delivery (guardrails, not manual gates)
