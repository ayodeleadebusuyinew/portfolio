# Projects (Proof of Work)

This section is a recruiter-friendly map of the repositories I maintain and what each one proves about my operating level.

## Platform Engineering
- **terraform-aws-eks-platform**  
  Enterprise-ready EKS platform patterns: VPC design, IAM/IRSA, cluster add-ons, upgrade-ready structure, and repeatable environments.

## CI/CD Reliability (Progressive Delivery)
- **cicd-canary-auto-rollback**  
  Reference pipeline that demonstrates: security gates, canary rollout, automated verification, and rollback under failure conditions.

## Observability + SLO Discipline
- **observability-slo-pack**  
  Dashboards, alert rules, and SLO examples aligned to golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) and practical on-call actionability.

## DevSecOps Guardrails
- **devsecops-guardrails**  
  Pipeline and IaC guardrails (scanning, policy gates, vulnerability workflows) that enforce security without slowing delivery.

## SRE Runbooks & Incident Response
- **runbooks-incident-response**  
  Operational readiness pack: triage playbooks, rollback steps, comms templates, and postmortem structure.
